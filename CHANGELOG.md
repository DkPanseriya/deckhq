## 1.2.0

The release that can actually be installed. 1.1.0 called itself the first public release and was
then never pushed to the registry, so `npx deckhq` — the README's only install instruction —
returned `E404` for the whole of its life. Every other improvement in this project was academic
while that was true, so this release is mostly the unglamorous work of making one command work.

### Packaging

- **The package is publishable without a private-by-default accident.** `publishConfig.access` is
  now `public`. A scoped or first-time publish that omits it fails at the registry, or worse
  succeeds as a private package on an account that has no private plan.
- **A broken build can no longer reach the registry.** `prepublishOnly` runs `npm run lint` and
  `npm test` before anything is uploaded. Publishing is the one operation in this project that
  cannot be undone — npm unpublish is time-boxed and the version number is burned either way — so
  it is the one that gets the gate.
- **The description is the pitch again.** It used to end with "(Codex adapter included but
  unverified.)", which is honest and belongs in the README's Honest limits, where it still is. The
  description is the single line that appears in npm search results next to a dozen competitors;
  spending its last forty characters on a caveat about a secondary adapter was a bad trade. The
  caveat has not been softened, only moved.
- `control-plane` dropped from the keywords. DeckHQ does not orchestrate anything and should not
  turn up when someone searches for a tool that does. `claude`, `local-first` and `privacy` added,
  because those are what the intended user actually types.
- A `funding` field pointing at GitHub Sponsors, matching the new `.github/FUNDING.yml`.
- `package-lock.json` said `1.0.0`. It had not been regenerated for the 1.1.0 bump, so the one file
  whose job is to describe exactly what gets installed was describing a version two releases old.
  Now correct, and `*.tgz` is ignored so a stray `npm pack` cannot commit a tarball of the package
  into the package.

The tarball is unchanged at 39 files and 203 kB: `bin`, `src`, `public`, the README and the
licence. No state, no logs, no tests, no `docs/`, no `.claude/`.

### Repository

Everything a stranger looks for before they open a pull request, and none of which existed.

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, leading with the two things that get a change rejected regardless of how good
  it is: the invariant in `docs/01-PRODUCT.md` §2, and network egress. Both were only written down
  in the README's footer, where a contributor finds them after they have written the code.
- `SECURITY.md`, describing the actual model rather than a template one — loopback bind with no
  `--host` flag, why that is not sufficient on its own and what the CSRF guard adds, path-confined
  static serving, argv-array spawns, conversation text rendered as text — plus a private route to
  report something that is wrong with it.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1).
- Issue forms for bugs and features, and a pull request template. The bug form asks for the output
  of `deckhq doctor`, so an environment report arrives with the first message instead of after
  three round trips.
- `.github/FUNDING.yml`.
- `docs/plan/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`, the ordered commands for cutting a release, written down
  because the thing that went wrong with 1.1.0 was a step nobody had written down.

### Known gaps

Carried forward from `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` §8–9, unchanged by this release:

- **Codex support is unverified.** The adapter is written against documented rollout-file
  conventions and has never run against real Codex data.
- **`openInTerminal()` is verified on Windows only.** The macOS and Linux paths are implemented and
  reviewed but have not been run.

## 1.1.0

First public release. Everything below is a fix to something that would have bitten a real
`npx` user on a machine that is not the development machine.

### Fixed

- **State no longer lives in the package directory.** It moves to `~/.deckhq/state.json`, with
  `$DECKHQ_STATE_DIR` as an override. The old location was inside whatever directory `npx` or
  `npm -g` had installed the package into: the package manager is free to evict or replace it on a
  version bump, and a root-owned global install could not write to it at all. Both would have
  discarded every acknowledgement, bench and let-go — the user-owned half of the model — without
  saying anything. A `state.json` left beside the package by 1.0.0 is copied across once on first
  start; the original is left where it was.

- **Failed writes are reported, not just logged.** A store that cannot write is losing every
  acknowledgement made since it last succeeded. The header now says so and names the path.

- **Hooks are installed with the daemon's real port.** The hook command used to post to a
  hard-coded `127.0.0.1:4317`, but the daemon walks forward when 4317 is taken and accepts
  `--port`. In either case every event went nowhere while the settings file looked perfect and the
  header went on claiming exact state. The port is now written at install time, `installed()`
  reports false when the installed hooks point somewhere else, and the hooks screen offers a
  one-click reinstall that repoints them instead of stacking a second set.

- **The hooks screen reports delivery, not just installation.** It shows how many hook events have
  arrived and when the last one did, so an install that is silently not being delivered is visible
  rather than assumed to be fine.

- Settings backups moved from the package directory to `~/.deckhq/backups/`, for the same reason
  as the state file.

- `POST /api/ack` returns the agent it changed. `Registry.act()` had always returned `undefined`,
  so the `agent` field in that response was never populated.

### Removed

- `reference/` — the prototype that validated the idea against real data. It was never built on
  and is dead weight in a public tree. Still in git history at `v1.0.0`.
- `docs/00-PRODUCT-legacy.md`, superseded by `docs/01-PRODUCT.md`.

### Verified

- **`send()` now has been run end to end**, closing the gap `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` §9 recorded.
  `claude --resume <id> -p` was exercised against a throwaway session: it returns the _same_
  session id and appends both turns to the _same_ transcript file. It does not fork a new session,
  which would have put a duplicate agent on the floor for every reply.

### Added

- `scripts/demo-floor.mjs` builds a synthetic `~/.claude` in a temp directory and drives a daemon
  into all six states through the real hook endpoint, so the README screenshots can show the
  product working without publishing anyone's real project names or session titles.
- `scripts/capture-floor.mjs` photographs a running floor over the DevTools protocol. Chrome's own
  `--screenshot` flag is no use: it waits for the page to go quiet, and DeckHQ deliberately never
  does.

### Known gaps

Carried forward from `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` §8–9:

- **Codex support is unverified.** The adapter is written against documented rollout-file
  conventions and has never run against real Codex data.
- **`openInTerminal()` is verified on Windows only.** The macOS and Linux paths are implemented and
  reviewed but have not been run.

## 1.0.0

Initial build. See `docs/` for the blueprint and `docs/DEVIATIONS.md` for every departure from it.
